                Info  : "Sand Tiger Sharks look ferocious with a mouth full of pointy teeth, but our divers regularly jump in with them because they aren't dangerous to humans. \
                They are, however, voracious predators of small fish, crustaceans and squid, feeding mostly at night and close to the ocean floor. The Sand Tiger Shark has a very \
                unique and curious habit. They come up to the surface of the water to gulp air and hold it in their stomachs. Sharks are naturally negatively buoyant which means \
                they sink if they stop swimming. Holding air in their tummy like a balloon enables Sand Tigers to float motionless in the water without sinking. So they can silently \
                drift up close to their prey and quickly snatch it in their jaws. They can grow to be over 3 metres long and are found in warm or temperate waters throughout the \
                world’s ocean, with the exception of the Eastern Pacific.",

                Barbels are covered in taste buds and are very sensitive, helping the Nurse Shark to find food hidden in the sandy seabed. Most sharks must keep moving to \
                breath because they need water to flow over their gills, but Nurse Sharks can stop swimming and rest. That's because they can pump water through their mouths \
                and gills while they're sitting still. In the ocean Nurse Sharks can gather in groups of up to 40. They hide together under submerged ledges around coral reefs, \
                often piled up on top of each other. At night they become more active and venture out on their own to prey on sea snails, crustaceans, molluscs and other small fish.",

                        Normally, they eat other fish as food by using sharp teeth structure combined with swift and active swimming while attacking .But some \

                 for humans, it can lead to severe physical reactions. Since the injected toxin reacts to temperature, immersion of the affected area in hot water helps to neutralize it.\
