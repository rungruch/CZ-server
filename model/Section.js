                         conspicuous barbs in between her nostrils, which she uses to find food on the sandy bottoms, hence its name: her barbs look like nurse’s \
                         forceps, just like in surgery! Most sharks must keep moving to breathe?That's because they need water to flow over their gills. However,\
                          Nurse Sharks can stop swimming and rest because they can pump water through their mouths and gills while they're sitting still.\
                         Discover on your visit - the nursing sharks sprawled on the glass at the usual feeding time, just waiting for their snack! \

                Detail : "Coral Reefs are one of the most beautiful and important habitats on Earth. They cover less than 1% of the ocean floor, \
                yet over 25% (that's 1 quarter) of marine species depend on this habitat in some way for survival. The Coral itself might look like\
                rock or plant but it is actually a type of animal! From the same family as Jellyfish and Sea Anemones, Corals are made up of millions\
                of individual polyps all growing on top of each other. Each of these polyps lives within a shell but sticks out little stinging tentacles \
                to catch plankton in the current. Coral polyps share their shell with algae which provides them with most of their food using photosynthesis. \
                In exchange the Coral offers the algae a safe house so they both get a good deal!\
                When Corals are stressed by pollution, temperature or acidity changes, they spit out the algae from their shells. This is known as Coral bleaching \
                as it is the algae which gives them colour and without it they turn white. Coral cannot survive for long without this algae. ",

                 do this as they are protected by a layer of slimy mucus on their skin! Clownfish like to live in Sea Anemones so that they are protected\
                  from predators and can nibble on leftover food the Sea Anemone catches.In return, they help keep Sea Anemones and the area around them clean \
                  by eating up algae and other reef debris.\If you see a Clownfish couple in a Sea Anemone, the larger of the two will be the female, and the smaller the male.\
                They are called Clownfish because of their bright clown colouring and all clownfish are born as boys, once the females die the largest male will change sex.",
